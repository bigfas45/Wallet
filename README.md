**Question 1**
Node js is my favorite programming language at the moment, and below I will be giving three reasons why I prefer it to other programming languages I know.
i.Speed & Performance: Node.JS features a non-blocking event-driven architecture that allows many requests simultaneously, which speeds up code application. And ultimately, in Node.JS, single module caching is enabled, which eradicates app loading time and makes web apps more responsive.

ii. scalability: The main purpose of a web application is to allow a lot of new people/users to utilize the apps with no obstacle. Scalability is an app’s ability to assist a huge number of users with no error in its performance.

iii. Learning Curve: Nodejs was easier to learn, maybe because of my experience with other programming languages I have learned in the past. Due to its easy to learn feature

**Question 2**
We adopt the waterfall approach, the approach is as follows:
1. Requirements
2. Design
3. Execution
4. Testing
5. Release

I enjoy executing the projects, especially if all the project requirements and design have been put in place. Executing the project before very easy with less hassle.

I would like to include continuous delivery and integration to my software development live cycle, This will help configuration changes, bug fixes, and experiments into production, or the hands of users, safely and quickly in a sustainable way.

**Question 3**

I developed a Data-portal for my organization which allowed its Dealing Members (brokerage firms) access:
1.  Daily trade reports
2.  Historical market reports
3. Corporate Action Notices
4. Price and Market Trends depicted in a graphical illustration 

The Data Portal is also opened to members of the public at a subscription rate to allow them to make better-informed decisions before investing in stocks listed on the NASD OTC Securities Exchange.

The project is two-faced:  the back-end(API Nodejs) and the front-end that connects the API(Reactjs).


I was responsible for the back-end side of this project I also contributed to the front-end development 

**Question 4**
Inheritance because when the inheriting class ends up with a pile of methods/properties that are never used in the exposed interface. This creates more complexity than the child class needs to.

**Question 5**
I use an Express Rate Limitter for this, Basic rate-limiting middleware for Express. Use to limit repeated requests to public APIs and/or endpoints such as password reset.
